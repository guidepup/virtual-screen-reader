  Reliable unit testing for your screen reader a11y workflows through JavaScript.
</p>

## Intro

A11y static analysis tools [only cover 25% of WCAG](https://karlgroves.com/web-accessibility-testing-what-can-be-tested-and-how/) and don't assure on the quality of the user experience for screen reader users. This means teams need to perform lots of manual tests with multiple screen readers to ensure great UX which can take a lot of time... **not anymore!**

With Virtual Screen Reader you can automate your screen reader unit test workflows the same you as would for mouse or keyboard based scenarios, no sweat!

## Features

- **Mirrors Real User Experience** - assert on what users really do and hear when using screen readers.
- **Test Framework Agnostic** - run with Jest, with Playwright, as an independent script, no vendor lock-in.
- **UI Framework Agnostic** - want to use React, Vue, Solid, Svelte, etc.? All good here! Works with any UI framework, and plays nicely with the [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) suite.
- **Fast Feedback** - avoid the cumbersome overhead of running an e2e test with a running screen reader by running virtually over the provided DOM.

## Getting Started

Install Virtual Screen Reader to your project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @guidepup/virtual-screen-reader
```

And get cracking with your first screen reader unit test automation code!

```ts
import { virtual } from "@guidepup/virtual-screen-reader";

function setupBasicPage() {
  document.body.innerHTML = `
  <nav>Nav Text</nav>
  <section>
    <h1>Section Heading</h1>
    <p>Section Text</p>
    <article>
      <header>
        <h1>Article Header Heading</h1>
        <p>Article Header Text</p>
      </header>
      <p>Article Text</p>
    </article> 
  </section>
  <footer>Footer</footer>
  `;
}

describe("Screen Reader Tests", () => {
  test("should traverse the page announcing the expected roles and content", async () => {
    // Setup a page using a framework and testing library of your choice
    setupBasicPage();

    // Start your virtual screen reader instance
    await virtual.start({ container: document.body });

    // Navigate your environment with the virtual screen reader just as your users would
    while ((await virtual.lastSpokenPhrase()) !== "end of document") {
      await virtual.next();
    }

    // Assert on what your users would really see and hear when using screen readers
    expect(await virtual.spokenPhraseLog()).toEqual([
      "document",
      "navigation",
      "Nav Text",
      "end of navigation",
      "region",
      "heading, Section Heading, level 1",
      "Section Text",
      "article",
      "banner",
      "heading, Article Header Heading, level 1",
      "Article Header Text",
      "end of banner",
      "Article Text",
      "end of article",
      "end of region",
      "contentinfo",
      "Footer",
      "end of contentinfo",
      "end of document",
    ]);

    // Stop your virtual screen reader instance
    await virtual.stop();
  });
});
```
