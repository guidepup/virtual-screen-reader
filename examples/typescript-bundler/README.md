# TypeScript Bundler Example

A basic example where Virtual Screen Reader is used for a TypeScript application using a bundler.

Run this example with:

```bash
# Install and build core package
yarn install --frozen-lockfile

# Navigate to example, install, and test
cd examples/typescript-bundler
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
yarn test
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This example serves to demonstrate how you can use the Virtual Screen Reader. The components themselves may not be using best accessibility practices.
>
> Always evaluate your own components for accessibility and test with real users.
